> *This page describes how to deploy application using Terragrunt. If you want to use Terrafrom without Terragrunt, please follow the [next instruction](./clean_terraform)

he repo contains the next components:
- Application itself
- Terragrunt deployment configuration
- Terraform modules
	- Cluster - Creates a ECS Cluster and related services
	- Codebuild - Creates an AWS Codebuild job which starts automatically when code pushed to "develop" branch
	- ECR - Creates an Elastic Container repository
	- Init-Build - Builds and deploys initial image to ECR when new repository is created


## Configuration

Main configuration files are the next:

/providers/dev/terragrunt.hcl - Contains main variables for Terragrunt & Terraform:
- remote_state_bucket - S3 bucket for Terraform states
- envorinment - Environment name (dev, prod, etc)
- app_name - Name of Application (will be used for naming AWS resources)
- image_tag - Default value for Docker image tag. Will be used for initial build
- repo_url - GitHub repo URL
- aws_profile - The name of [AWS Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)
- aws_account - AWS Account ID
- aws_region - AWS Region for creating resources
- branch_pattern - Which branch changes should webhook watch on (e.g.: "^refs/heads/develop$")
- git_trigger_event - Event for [git webhook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_WebhookFilter.html) 
- app_count =  Number of launched applications. In our case 1 
- cluster_count = Number  of  cluster  instances
- subnet_count = Number  of  avzones


## Deployment

### Preparation

 - Install the required versions of Terragrunt and Terraform 
 - Configure AWS Cli for your account (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html))
 - Download the repo content
 - Update "locals" block in providers/dev/terragrunt.hcl file
 - Create "secrets.hcl" file and add db password tmdi_api and  bot token:

```
inputs = {
  github_token = "Private Github token"
  token = "Telegram bot token"
  api_key = "TMDB API key"
  db_pass = "DB password"
}
```
One command deployment

 - Go to the /providers/dev directory and run:

```
terragrunt run-all init
```

- Then...

```
terragrunt run-all plan
```

- And if there is no issues in generated plan:

```
terragrunt run-all apply
```

### Step by step deployment

Step by step deployment should be done in the next order:

1. ECR creation (`providers/dev/ecr`)
2. Initial build (`providers/dev/init-build`)
3. Cluster creation (`providers/dev/ecs-cluster`)
4. Codebuild job setup (`providers/dev/codebuild`)

Go to each folder one by one and run:

```
terragrunt plan
```

- When plan is completed run:

```
terragrunt apply
```

- Go to the next directory when deployment completed. 

When resources creation is finished you can push a new version to "develop" branch of the repo you described in `env.hcl` file to initiate a new build 

### Destroy infrastructure

You can destroy everything you deployed with the next command which should be executed in `dev/` directory:

```
terraform run-all destroy
```

Or you can destroy components step by step in reverse order from deployment. Go to the appropriate directory and run:

```
terragrunt destroy
```

### Manual Version Rollback

In some cases you may need to rollback current version running on ECS. This can be done manually using Teraform & Terragrunt. 

Before running Terragrunt you should go to Elastic Container Registry and select the tag of image you want to run on ECS. Then follow the next steps:

```
cd providers/dev/ecs-cluster && terragrunt plan --var image_tag="TAG_OF_REQUIRED_IMAGE"
```

Then review generated plan and if you agree to incoming changes, run:

``` 
terragrunt apply --var image_tag="TAG_OF_REQUIRED_IMAGE"
```

and confirm changes.

### Manual application build and deploy

To build and deploy application manually, first, you should go to application directory and run build

``` bash
cd app/

export AWS_PROFILE="YOUR AWS PROFILE NAME"
export TAG="NEW IMAGE TAG"
export APP_NAME="flaskapp" # (optional)
export ENV_NAME="dev" # (optional)

make build 
```

Wait until application is deployed to ECR then go to `providers/dev/ecs-cluster`and run Terragrunt:

```
terragrunt plan --var image_tag="NEW IMAGE TAG"
```

Then review generated plan and if you agree to incoming changes, run:

``` 
terragrunt apply --var image_tag="NEW IMAGE TAG"
```

and confirm changes.
